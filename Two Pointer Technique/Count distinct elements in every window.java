// Given an integer array arr[] and a number k. Find the count of distinct elements in every window of size k in the array.
// Examples:
// Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 3], k = 4
// Output: [3, 4, 4, 3]
// Explanation:
// First window is [1, 2, 1, 3], count of distinct numbers is 3.
// Second window is [2, 1, 3, 4] count of distinct numbers is 4.
// Third window is [1, 3, 4, 2] count of distinct numbers is 4.
// Fourth window is [3, 4, 2, 3] count of distinct numbers is 3.
// Input: arr[] = [4, 1, 1], k = 2
// Output: [2, 1]
// Explanation:
// First window is [4, 1], count of distinct numbers is 2.
// Second window is [1, 1], count of distinct numbers is 1.
